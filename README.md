# Assembly experiments
Some experimentation with Assembly -- Low-level programming HYPE


## hello.asm
It's just a "Hello, World!". No biggie.

    <i>output: 1536 bytes</i>
</p>

This is the hexadecimal output represented as little squares (each 6 bytes of output become one hexadecimal color on one square). As you can see (maybe not though), it's filled with unwanted useless unused zeroes (`#00 00 00`). I'm open for suggestions on how to remove them.

I'm currently using GoLink. I think it may be at fault. Will investigate eventually.
